        <p><a href="https://cs.unc.edu/undergraduate/degrees/placement-by-examination/"> There is a placement test for
                COMP110 only available in the summer.</a>
        <p>If you have never took a programming course before you may find this course difficult. So it's better to have
            full exposure to this course, so that you may find it easy when you take in the future. </p>
        AP Computer Science A credit with a score of 5 can be substitued for COMP110 credit.</p>
        <p>COMP110 is a more better foundational course than AP Computer Science A and many other foundational
            programming tutorials found on youtube and other platforms. So I would suggest taking COMP110 over other
            courses, but have full exposure to it before taking it. Follow the latest offering of the course and the
            professor you might potentially take it with.</p>
        <p>
            All necessary information on COMP110 is in their respective semester-wise course offering link.
